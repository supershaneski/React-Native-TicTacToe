# React-Native-TicTacToe

A simple Tic-Tac-Toe game using [React-Native](https://reactnative.dev) and [Expo](https://expo.dev).

Most of the logic of the implementation (e.g. checking for winner) is taken from [ReactJS tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#completing-the-game).

The main objective of this project is to get familiar using React Native.

## Setup

Before running the project, install first the required modules by running:

> `npm install`


Then run:

> `expo start`
